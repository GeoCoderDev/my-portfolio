    "2O-SINTH is my first project created with the help of the Web Audio API. It is an interactive and attractive application that I made based on the FL Studio program, which allows the user to explore and experiment with the different clickable, sliding, rotating controls, etc. to create different sounds and make melodies with those sounds, additionally you can make rhythms as well.",
    "With this project I learned a lot about HTML and CSS (advanced selectors, flexbox, media queries, etc.), to use various types of events in depth using their respective Event object, the basics of the <canvas> element, to use an API relatively basic (CRUD), to make forms for user authentication and registration and many other knowledge that were necessary to carry out this project.",
    "As mentioned, 2O-SINTH also has a backend (a simple API) that allows user authentication, saving data for each user, etc. Which I consider to be a separate project and would be the one that follows in this section.",
  ],
  "Descripcion-Proyecto-2": [
    "This project was born from the need to provide authentication to 2O-SINTH users and allow them to create accounts in the application. This with the purpose of providing a way to store and manage melodies, rhythms, sounds and other data related to the application in its MySQL database.",
    "The API is designed to allow users to log in with their unique credentials, such as their username and password. All this allows users to save their creations and access them at any time and from any device and safely.",

  "Descripcion-Proyecto-3": [
    "Temchat is a project that I developed to chat with strangers, similar to the popular Omegle web application that also has this functionality, with the difference that Temchat allows you the possibility of sending CHAT REQUESTS with a certain time limit, searching for users by name among other functionalities.",
    "This project allowed me to learn much more about the backend such as using web sockets, working with non-relational databases, displaying data (searched users in this case) requested by the user to the MongoDB database, etc., which I invite you to try yourself. yourself by watching the short video demonstration of using the application attached in the image.",
  ],
  "Descripcion-Proyecto-4":
    "This application is a software tool designed to find optimal solutions to mathematical optimization problems. It will allow the user to enter data on various types of programming problems and obtain detailed solutions in a very similar way to applications like PhpSimplex.",
  "Descripcion-Proyecto-5":
    "This application is a Virtual Classroom that I am developing with the help of a group of classmates from my university for a school in the province of Cañete with functionalities very similar to those of Moddle and Google Classroom among other additional ones.",
